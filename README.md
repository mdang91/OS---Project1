# OS-Project1
- Data structure called Process() that stores PID Cycles and memory.
- data structure called called Schedule() that stores the schedule in and array list of Proccesses, 
   the number of proccesses in the schedule, the speed of the CPU being used and the the available memory of the cpu. 
   Speed and Memory will be used with the later question
- main program called Scheduler it has functions for FIF SJF and RR, also reads for a csv file to compile the master list. 
   Passes a cloned version of master to the different function (FIFO, SJF,RR).
   And it as a Times fuctions (WIP) that will return average wait time and turn around time. 
   I'm thinking I'll split this into two different functions soon.
